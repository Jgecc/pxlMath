pxlMath
-------
pxlMath is a website to easyly create Latex formulas. It can also simplify, evaluate and calculate the exact
value of a equation. It also lets you download a svg version of the equation. The Website is at the moment
in a **usable** state. It's buggy and ugly. Hopefully it will be developed and maintained further if I find
the time needed.
